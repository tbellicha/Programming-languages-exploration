Here is my little program for C/C++
It needs to have "make" installed, so you can run the program by executing "./run" in your terminal (do "chmod +x run" if needed).

First, choose your driver by entering a number of the Driver's list
Then, choose the track that you want to race on

## Going further
In the future, I will add the number of laps for each tracks
I will also add the strategy for the drivers, so they can choose their tires and when to pit
I will add the possibility to choose the weather, so the track will be wet or dry
I will add the possibility for drivers to crash, so they will have to retire from the race
I will add the championship, so the drivers will have to race on all the tracks and the winner will be the one with the most points
